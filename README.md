Scripts for quickly installing and configuring software into a usable state, ready for TDD.

The Node.js quick installer (NodejsTDD_QuickInstall.sh) is a linux script for installing and configuring Node.js, Mocha, and NPM to a point where Test Driven Development can be performed immediately. Some simple code is automatically generated, which should pass as 'green' as soon as an npm test command is executed by the developer. A project folder is created and named as specified by the developer during the installation process.

The script was initially made for Ubuntu 15.04, but should run on other distributions with some tweaking.
